# Changelog (All notable changes will be documented here)
## 🔢 Versioning System: `[Zig]-[Memoir]`

* **The Environment `[0.15.2]`**: Matches the specific Zig version the memoir is currently targeting.
* **The Memoir `[0.0.1]`**: Tracks the progress of this project.
    * **Major (X.0.0)**: When the repo is formatted in a major way to update to a higher zig version.
    * **Minor (0.X.0)**: New chapters, major logic additions, or new files.
    * **Patch (0.0.X)**: Typos, formatting, or refining existing entries.

> - When the Zig version changes (e.g., 0.15.2 → 0.16.0), the memoir version resets to `[0.16.0]-[0.1]` for that new environment.
> - Main branch is udated whenever we have a minor or major update is there in repo.
