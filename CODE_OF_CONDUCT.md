# Code of Conduct & Collaboration Guide

## 🛠 How This Repo Evolves
This is a **Personal but Not Private (PNP)** project. To maintain a balance between a personal memoir and a high-quality community resource, the following workflow is used:

* **The Dev Branch:** All active development, experimentation, and drafting happen in the `dev` branch. The `main` branch is reserved for stable, "finalized" versions of the journalized resource.
* **Version Control:** New versions (e.g., 0.0.1 → 0.0.2) are built incrementally on `dev`.
* **Decision Making:** I actively monitor the **Discussions** tab and PR comments. Content is added, removed, or modified based on these community insights.

## ✍️ Attribution & Transparency
I believe in technical honesty and giving credit where it's due. When a suggestion or critique leads to a change in the code or documentation:
* **Citations:** I will quote the reason for the change in the source code comments.
* **Shout-outs:** I will credit the individual(s) who provided the insight by username within those comments (e.g., `// Suggestion by @username: Use a slice here instead of a pointer for safety`).

## 🤝 Respectfulness & Environment
To prioritize **curiosity and technical growth** above all else, please, adhere to the following:

1.  **Technical Honesty:** Brutal honesty regarding Zig logic is encouraged. If code is inefficient or "un-Ziggy," say so.
2.  **Professionalism over Ego:** Focus critiques on the *code*, not the *person*. We are all here to learn, and memory management is hard.
3.  **Zero Tolerance:** Harassment, derogatory language, or "gatekeeping" behavior will result in an immediate block.
4.  **Signal over Noise:** Keep discussions focused on Zig conventions and the project's goals.

## ⚖️ Enforcement
As the maintainer, I reserve the right to:
* Edit, delete, or hide comments that violate the spirit of this conduct.
* Block individuals who repeatedly disrupt the learning environment.
* Make the final decision on which conventions are "standardized" in the memoir.
